			<p>What is Git?</p>
			<p>GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted for free through GitHub. GitHub users can create and host both personal websites ( one allowed per user)  and websites related to specific GitHub projects. Pages lets you  
			do the same things as GitHub, but if the repository is named a certain way and files inside it are HTML, you can view the file like any other website.</p>
			<p>Who started Git?</p>
			<p> Linus Torvalds Invented Git, But He Pulls No Patches With GitHub. Linus Torvalds keeps a copy of his Linux kernel project on GitHub, the wildly popular code-hosting website. But there's a caveat.</p>
			<p>What is Hub?</p>
			<p>Hub is a tool that wraps git in order to extend it with extra functionality that makes it better when working with GitHub.</p>
			<p>Describe Repository and its role?</p>
			<p>A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</p>
			<p>My thoughts about GitHub</p>
			<p>Just start to know about GitHub. It is a really good web base to share, learn, work on a project</p>
